  The project is about a web application that maintains the power grid of the country. It named as ElectroGrid and all the data that belongs to the power consumption of the users monitor from the system, generate the monthly bills, and automatically send to the users and accept the online payments from the users, maintains by via online system. 

We used the agile methodology. The Agile methodology is a method of project management that divides a project into phases. It includes clear information with stakeholders as well as continuous improvement at each stage. When the developing starts, the developing teams can go through a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating. 

We identified stakeholders as Clients, Admin, Staff members, Accountant. Then we gathered the requirements and started our developing process. To meet the needs of stakeholders, we create a few Web API services. Then we designed the database and set up a git repository to keep track of our project contributions. We had a testing phase after each step of development to validate and test the application's development. Unit testing is used to test individual pieces of code to see if they are ready for use and to find and fix bugs. After all the microservices were integrated, Integrated Testing was used to test the system to identify any errors and mistakes. Finally, we fix all the errors and make the system work without having errors.
